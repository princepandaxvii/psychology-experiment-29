    <h1>Instructions of the Ultimatum Game. Please read them carefully</h1>
    <div id="instructions">
      This game is played in rounds by two human players randomly paired.

      In each round, one of the them, called <em>BIDDER</em>, makes an
      offer to the other player, called <em>RESPONDENT</em>, about how
      to share <span class="coins">100</span> ECU (Experimental
      Currency). <span class="coins">100</span> ECU are equal to
      <span id="exchange-rate">0.05</span> USD.

      <br><br> The RESPONDENT can either accept or reject the offer of
      the BIDDER. If he / she accepts, both players
      split <span class="coins">100</span> ECU accordingly, else both
      get 0.
      <br><br>

      The game is repeated <span id="rounds">20</span> rounds.

      <br><br>
      <p id="pp" class="important">
        Important. If one of the players disconnects for more
        than <span id="wait-time">30</span> seconds the game will be
        terminated.<br/>  In such a case the player who disconnected
        will not be paid at all, and the remaining ones will be paid
        only the show up fee.
