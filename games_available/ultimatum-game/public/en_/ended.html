    We usually pay within 24 hours. For any problem, please look for a HIT called <strong>Ultimatum Trouble Ticket</strong> and file a new trouble ticket reporting the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>your turker id</li>
      <li>the HIT name: <em>nodeGame</em></li>
      <li>your exit code, as written below</li>
      <li>your browser name and version</li>
    </ul>
    <br/> Notice: you do not need the exit code to submit the HIT, but only in case of trouble with the payment.
